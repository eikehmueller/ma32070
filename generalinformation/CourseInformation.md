# General information: Scientific Computing (MA32070/40177)

Unit convenor: Eike Mueller, 4West 2.17, e.mueller@bath.ac.uk

## Lectures/computer labs

* 2 hour session every Tuesday 14:15h - 16:05h
* location: EB 0.9
* mixture of lectures and labs, varying throughout the semester

While the lectures will be recorded and there are detailed lecture notes (see below), please make sure that you attend them in person. You are very welcome to ask questions at any point.

## Office hour

Every Tuesday 11:15h - 12:05h

## Assessment

* 1 piece of coursework, accounting for 100% of the module mark
* You will have two weeks to complete the coursework assignment
* It will involve a mixture of implementation task and mathematical derivations
* Set at the end of the semester

## Lecture notes
Detailed notes and the slides of the lectures are available through the link on the moodle webpage.

## Programming in Python
We will use the PETSc/petsc4py library, which has been installed on Noteable. To set everything up you will need to complete a few steps at the beginning of the semester, there is a link on the moodle page with detailed information. Please follow these instructions to set up a working environment on Noteable as soon as possible.

You are very welcome to use your own computer, and there are instructions for this as well. Please note that if you do choose to use your own computer you do this on your own risk, in particular it will be your responsible to set it up correctly and make sure that data is saved correctly. Problems with your own setup are no valid justification for coursework extensions.

## Prerequisites
The moodle page contains a link to a list of topics that I assume you are familiar with. This includes both mathematical concepts and fundamentals of Python programming. If anything looks unfamiliar please make sure that you read up on it and/or as in the lectures.

This course is meant to be taken together with MA32066, and I assume that you engage with the content of this course.

## Problem sheets
There will be a range of exercises throughout the semester. Most of these require you to write some computer code, and it is very important that you engage with these exercises: while the exercises do not form part of the assessment, doing so will make the coursework much easier.

Unless they are marked otherwise, you are welcome to submit your solutions on moodle and I will provide feedback on your work. Please familiarise yourself with the submission instructions and follow them exactly since you will need to do the same when submitting the coursework.

Model solutions will be published, but you will get much more out of the course if you have a go at the exercises yourself.
